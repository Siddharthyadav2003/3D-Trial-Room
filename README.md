# 3D Trial Room

## Project Description

The 3D Trial Room is an innovative web-based platform that revolutionizes the online shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on clothes. This interactive tool bridges the gap between online and in-store shopping, enabling customers to visualize how different garments would look on them without the need for physical try-ons.

## Key Features

- **Virtual Try-On**: Users can select from a range of clothing items and see them rendered on a 3D model in real-time.
- **3D Visualization**: High-quality 3D rendering of clothing items for a realistic preview.
- **Customizable Avatar**: Users can adjust the avatar to match their body type for a more personalized experience.
- **Multi-Angle View**: Rotate the 3D model to view outfits from different angles.
- **Mix and Match**: Combine different clothing items to create complete outfits.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully functional across various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the web application.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For interactive features and 3D rendering.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- **WebGL**: For hardware-accelerated 3D graphics in the browser.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Siddharthyadav2003/3d-Trial-Room.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
